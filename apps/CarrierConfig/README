Default Carrier Config App
==========================

This app works as part of com.android.phone.CarrierConfigLoader to configure telephony features
based on the subscriber's network. It replaced many XML resource overlays in frameworks/base and
frameworks/opt/telephony. The current framework allows per-network configuration that uses
CarrierIdentifier objects, rather than just mcc/mnc. per-network configuration files live in assets
folder. Two ways to configure per-network configuration. Preferred way is
carrier_config_carrierid_<carrierid>_<carriername>.xml
AOSP carrier ID assignments can be found at
https://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/providers/TelephonyProvider/+/master/assets/carrier_list.textpb
use carrier_config_mccmnc_<mccmnc>.xml only if there is no matching carrier id.

This app uses a CarrierIdentifier to read the appropriate config snippets from the assets folder.

If you make changes to the XML files, run the unit tests to ensure they can still be parsed:
    runtest carrierconfig-unit
