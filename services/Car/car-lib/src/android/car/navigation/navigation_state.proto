// A reference to an image. This consists of a 'content://' style URI plus
// attributes describing the image.
//
// Sizing: The aspect ratio of the image is given in aspect_ratio.
//         When requesting the image using this URI a 'w' and 'h' parameter
//         must be added to the URI parameter list to request an image size.
//         There is no guarantee that the specific size requested will actually
//         be returned, however.
// Margins: The referenced image does not have internal margins.
// Format: Content URI must reference a file with MIME type
//         'image/png', 'image/jpeg' or 'image/bmp'.
// Color: Images can be either "tintable" or not. A "tintable" image is such that
//        all its content is defined in its alpha channel, while its color
//        (all other channels) can be altered without losing information
//        (e.g. icons). A non "tintable" images contains information in all its
//        channels (e.g. photos).
// Caching: Given the same image reference and the same requested size,
//          it is assumed that the exact same image will always be returned.
//          This means that it should be safe to cache an image once requested
